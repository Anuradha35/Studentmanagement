mujhe samaj nahi aa raha kaha changes karne hai ye mera pura code hai b meri problem ye hai ki maine same name with same father name se pehle ek course main enter kiya like CNC then dusare utr/upi or reciept ya both in single payment ya group payment main maine ek aur course me admission liya like PLC . now i use different reciept ya utr/upi or both with same name and father name to ise dono course check karne chahiye na ki sirf single .thaki main fir se unhi course main admission na le lu
What These Changes Do:

Enhanced Duplicate Detection: Now checks ALL courses and finds ALL instances of the same student name + father name combination
Better Logic:

If found in SAME course → Shows blocking modal (prevents duplicate admission)
If found in DIFFERENT course(s) → Shows confirmation with list of all existing courses


Clearer Messages: Shows exactly which courses the student is already enrolled in
Allows Multiple Courses: Student can be enrolled in CNC, PLC, etc. - different courses are allowed
Prevents Same Course Duplicates: Blocks if trying to enroll the same student in the same course again

This will solve your problem where you want to prevent duplicate admissions in the same course but allow the same student to enroll in different courses like CNC and PLC.
