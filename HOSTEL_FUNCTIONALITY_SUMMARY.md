    groupMembers?: string[];
  }>;
}
```

### 2. **Update Parent Component**
```typescript
const handleAddHostelPayment = (studentId: string, hostelPayment: any) => {
  // Add to hostelPayments array
  setAppData(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    hostelPayments: [...prev.hostelPayments, {
      id: Date.now().toString(),
      ...hostelPayment,
